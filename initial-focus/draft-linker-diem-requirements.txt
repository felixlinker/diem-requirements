2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Use Cases and Requirements for Initial Scope

3.1.  Digital Emblems under International Humanitarian Law

   The Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols constitute the
   core of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and establish legal
   rules on the conduct of armed conflict.  Some assets enjoy certain
   specific protections under IHL, including that they must not be
   attacked, and IHL codifies four types of protective emblems for armed
   conflict, which inform other parties of these certain specific
   protections.  Note that assets enjoy there protections irrespective
   of whether they are marked with the respective emblem.  The emblem
   only serves to inform others of these protections.

   *  The emblems of the Red Cross, Red Crescent, and Red Crystal are
      applied to assets of the medical services as well as the assets of
      certain humanitarian operations.

   *  The Blue Shield emblem is applied to cultural property.

   *  The emblem for the protection of civil defense is applied to
      certain assets for the protection of the civilian population
      against the dangers of hostilities or disasters.

   *  The dangerous forces emblem is applied to works or installations
      containing dangerous forces, i.e., dams, dikes, and nuclear
      generating facilities.

3.1.1.  Requirements

   Digital emblems under IHL MUST identify the issuing party and MUST
   provide a means for authorization by third parties.  Additionally,
   this use case has the following requirements:

   *  Authenticity

   *  Authorization and Decentralized Authorization

   *  Accountability

   *  Revocation

   *  Undetectable Validation

4.  Other Use Cases and Requirements

   The focus of the initial DIEM efforts does not include the following
   use cases.  They are listed here for documentation and future
   reference.  The requirements of these use cases are not complete and
   would need to be investigated further when addressing the use cases.

4.1.  Marking of Hazardous Materials

   The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the
   International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and the Basel Convention
   require that certain, dangerous materials are marked during shipment.
   Concretely:

   *  The OPCW requires marking of Schedule 1 chemicals.

   *  The IAEA administers several treaties related to the shipment of
      atomic fuels and wasters across borders.

   *  The Basel Convention regulates the trans-boundary movement of
      hazardous wastes.

   An emblem MUST provide a description, location, date, and quantity.
   The description MUST be accessible only by authorized parties, e.g.,
   customs agencies or material handlers.

4.2.  Marking of Brand-Associated Shipments

   World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) administers treaties,
   in particular the Madrid Protocol, that allow brands to mark their
   shipments with an emblem so that customs agents can identify
   legitimate products.

   An emblem MUST identify the copyright/brand image, provide a textual
   description of the shipment, and a chain-of-custody/provenance.

4.3.  Marking of Civil Aviation Flights

   The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) requires that
   civil aviation flights are protected and that one can verify them to
   not be dual-use, e.g., not carrying military cargo.

   An emblem MUST carry a geographic description of the flight plan, its
   current location, and a textual description of the flight including
   its manifest, identifying characteristics, e.g., tail number.  An
   emblem may need to also reference a flight manifest.

5.  Requirements

5.1.  Authenticity

   Validators MUST be able to verify that an emblem was issued for the
   respective bearer, issued by the claimed issuer (where applicable),
   and that none of its associated data was changed.

5.2.  Authorization

   Validators MUST be able to verify that an emblem issuer was
   authorized to issue the emblem.  Authorizing parties MAY limit what
   emblems an issuer can issue, e.g., they MAY limit issuance to certain
   bearers.

5.2.1.  Decentralized Authorization

   Anyone MUST be able to authorize an issuer.

5.3.  Accountability

   Emblem issuance and authorization of issuers (where applicable) MUST
   be attributable to issuers and authorizing parties.  Authorizing
   parties and emblem issuers MUST NOT be able to repudiate that they
   issued an emblem or authorization.

5.4.  Revocation

   Emblems and authorizations (where applicable) MUST be revokable
   within reasonable windows of time.  Depending on the design, it may
   suffice to rely on expiration of short-lived emblems and
   authorization effectively as a revocation mechanism.

5.5.  Undetectable Validation

   Emblem issuers MUST NOT be able to detect whether someone is
   requesting or validating emblems issued by them.

5.6.  Visual

   An emblem MUST be capable of carrying a visual representation of the
   physical emblem it represents.

5.7.  Law Carrying

   An emblem MUST carry an unambiguous indication of the international
   law or laws conferring the semantics of the emblem.

5.8.  Proximity-Based Distribution

   An emblem MUST be presentable using an in-band, proximity-based
   protocol such as a QR code or RFID.

5.9.  Physical Binding

   An emblem MUST be possible to associate with physical assets, e.g.,
   buildings, vehicles, or containers.

5.9.1.  Quantifiable

   An emblem MUST be possible to associate with a range or specific
   quantity of associated, physical assets.

5.10.  Identity Binding

   An emblem MUST be possible to associate with a person or group of
   people.
