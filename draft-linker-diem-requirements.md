## Use Cases

### Digital Emblems under International Humanitarian Law

The Geneva Conventions and their *Additional Protocols* (APs) constitute the core of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and establish legal rules on the conduct of armed conflict.
They codify four types of protective emblems, which inform other parties that assets bearing them must not be attacked:

- The emblems of the Red Cross, Red Crystal, and Red Crescent is applied to assets that undertake medical functions.
- The Blue Shield emblem to identify cultural property.
- The emblem for the protection of civil defense.
- The emblem to identify objects containing dangerous forces, i.e., whose destruction can release dangerous forces.

Digital emblems under IHL MUST identify the issuing party and MUST provide a means for authorization by third parties.
