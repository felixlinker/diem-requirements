2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and

3.  Use Cases and Requirements for Initial Scope

4.  Other Use Cases and Requirements

5.  Requirements

5.1.  Authenticity

   Validators MUST be able to verify that an emblem was issued for the
   respective bearer, issued by the claimed issuer (where applicable),
   and that none of its associated data was changed.

5.2.  Authorization

   Validators MUST be able to verify that an emblem issuer was
   authorized to issue the emblem.  Authorizing parties MAY limit what
   emblems an issuer can issue, e.g., they MAY limit issuance to certain
   bearers.

5.2.1.  Decentralized Authorization

   Anyone MUST be able to authorize an issuer.

5.3.  Accountability

   Emblem issuance and authorization of issuers (where applicable) MUST
   be attributable to issuers and authorizing parties.  Authorizing
   parties and emblem issuers MUST NOT be able to repudiate that they
   issued an emblem or authorization.

5.4.  Revocation

   Emblems and authorizations (where applicable) MUST be revokable
   within reasonable windows of time.  Depending on the design, it may
   suffice to rely on expiration of short-lived emblems and
   authorization effectively as a revocation mechanism.

5.5.  Undetectable Validation

   Emblem issuers MUST NOT be able to detect whether someone is
   requesting or validating emblems issued by them.

5.6.  Visual

   An emblem MUST be capable of carrying a visual representation of the
   physical emblem it represents.

5.7.  Law Carrying

   An emblem MUST carry an unambiguous indication of the international
   law or laws conferring the semantics of the emblem.

5.8.  Proximity-Based Distribution

   An emblem MUST be presentable using an in-band, proximity-based
   protocol such as a QR code or RFID.

5.9.  Physical Binding

   An emblem MUST be possible to associate with physical assets, e.g.,
   buildings, vehicles, or containers.

5.9.1.  Quantifiable

   An emblem MUST be possible to associate with a range or specific
   quantity of associated, physical assets.

5.9.2.  Geographic

   An emblem MUST be restrictable by geographic scope.

5.10.  Identity Binding

   An emblem MUST be possible to associate with a person or group of
   people.
