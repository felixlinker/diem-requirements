2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and

3.  Use Cases and Requirements for Initial Scope

3.1.  Use Cases

3.1.1.  Digital Emblems under International Humanitarian Law

   The Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols constitute the
   core of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and establish legal
   rules on the conduct of armed conflict.  They codify four types of
   protective emblems for armed conflict, which inform other parties of
   certain specific protections under IHL, including that they must not
   be attacked.

   *  The emblems of the Red Cross, Red Crescent, and Red Crystal are
      applied to assets of the medical services as well as the assets of
      certain humanitarian operations.

   *  The Blue Shield emblem is applied to cultural property.

   *  The emblem for the protection of civil defense is applied to
      certain assets for the protection of the civilian population
      against the dangers of hostilities or disasters.

   *  The dangerous forces emblem is applied to works or installations
      containing dangerous forces, i.e., dams, dikes, and nuclear
      generating facilities.

   Digital emblems under IHL MUST identify the issuing party and MUST
   provide a means for authorization by third parties.

3.2.  Requirements

3.2.1.  Authenticity

   Validators MUST be able to verify that an emblem was issued for the
   respective bearer, issued by the claimed issuer (where applicable),
   and that none of its associated data was changed.

   Use cases that have this requirement:

   *  Emblems under IHL

3.2.2.  Authorization

   Validators MUST be able to verify that an emblem issuer was
   authorized to issue the emblem.  Authorizing parties MAY limit what
   emblems an issuer can issue, e.g., they MAY limit issuance to certain
   bearers.

   Use cases that have this requirement:

   *  Emblems under IHL

3.2.2.1.  Decentralized Authorization

   Anyone MUST be able to authorize an issuer.

   Use cases that have this requirement:

   *  Emblems under IHL

3.2.3.  Accountability

   Emblem issuance and authorization of issuers (where applicable) MUST
   be attributable to issuers and authorizing parties.  Authorizing
   parties and emblem issuers MUST NOT be able to repudiate that they
   issued an emblem or authorization.

   Use cases that have this requirement:

   *  Emblems under IHL

3.2.3.1.  Revocation

   Emblems and authorizations MUST be revokable within reasonable
   windows of time.  Depending on the design, it may suffice to rely on
   expiration of short-lived emblems and authorization effectively as a
   revocation mechanism.

   Use cases that have this requirement:

   *  Emblems under IHL

3.2.4.  Undetectable Validation

   Emblem issuers MUST NOT be able to detect whether someone is
   requesting or validating emblems issued by them.

   Use cases that have this requirement:

   *  Emblems under IHL

4.  Other Use Cases and Requirements
