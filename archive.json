Please let me know if you would like these requirements to be included. I am not certain of all text and will add some comments to the PR. Would be great to receive some input here!\r\n\r\nMy plan for the structure of the document is to add use cases to either as part of the initial scope or as other and then list at each requirement which use case has it. I find this the clearest to understand the problem space! Open to feedback here to.\r\n\r\nFor now, I put all requirements into the \"other\" part because there are no use cases in the initial scope section. As soon as we add use cases for the initial scope, we can move requirements up one by one.",

(It's a bit more nuanced, because iirc are chosen by browser vendors, i.e., the spec doesn't mandate a dedicated set of authorizers, but I hope the example still helps.) This is a requirement for emblems under IHL, because displaying them (most often) requires authorization from states, but states themselves must not require authorization to do so.\r\n\r\nMaybe \"anyone\" is a bit too strict, though. I don't need my mother to authorize emblem usage :)",

For example, a draft could say: \"There is a IANA registry for DIEM-authorizing parties and a DIEM designated experts group decides who is in that registry and validators must only accept emblems authorized by one of these issuers.\" This would be a straightforward violation of that requirement.\r\n\r\nIf I decide tomorrow that I want to authorize someone to display digital emblems, I should be able to do that with reaonsable effort. I should not be required to ask for permission from a fixed authority, or I should not be required to be in some registry or similar.",
