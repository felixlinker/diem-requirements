2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in

3.  Use Cases and Requirements for Initial Scope

3.1.  Use Cases

3.2.  Requirements

4.  Other Use Cases and Requirements

4.1.  Use Cases

4.2.  Requirements

4.2.1.  Authenticity

   Validators MUST be able to verify that an emblem was issued for the
   respective bearer, issued by the claimed issuer (where applicable),
   and that none of its associated data was changed.

   Use cases that have this requirement:

4.2.2.  Authorization

   Validators MUST be able to verify that an emblem issuer was
   authorized to issue the emblem.  Authorizing parties MAY limit what
   emblems an issuer can issue, e.g., they MAY limit issuance to certain
   bearers.

   Use cases that have this requirement:

4.2.2.1.  Decentralized Authorization

   Anyone MUST be able to authorize an issuer.

   Use cases that have this requirement:

4.2.3.  Accountability

   Emblem issuance and authorization of issuers (where applicable) MUST
   be attributable to issuers and authorizing parties.  Authorizing
   parties and emblem issuers MUST NOT be able to repudiate that they
   issued an emblem or authorization.

   Use cases that have this requirement:

4.2.3.1.  Revocation

   Emblems and authorizations MUST be revokable within reasonable
   windows of time.  Depending on the design, it may suffice to rely on
   expiration of short-lived emblems and authorization effectively as a
   revocation mechanism.

   Use cases that have this requirement:

4.2.4.  Undetectable Validation

   Emblem issuers MUST NOT be able to detect whether someone is
   requesting or validating emblems issued by them.

   Use cases that have this requirement:

4.2.5.  Visual

   An emblem MUST be capable of carrying a visual representation of the
   physical emblem it represents.

   Use cases that have this requirement:

4.2.6.  Law Carrying

   An emblem MUST carry an unambiguous indication of the international
   law or laws conferring the semantics of the emblem.

   Use cases that have this requirement:

4.2.7.  Proximity-Based Distribution

   An emblem MUST be presentable using an in-band, proximity-based
   protocol such as a QR code or RFID.

   Use cases that have this requirement:

4.2.8.  Physical Binding

   An emblem MUST be possible to associate with physical assets, e.g.,
   buildings, vehicles, or containers.

   Use cases that have this requirement:

4.2.8.1.  Quantifiable

   An emblem MUST be possible to associate with a range or specific
   quantity of associated, physical assets.

   Use cases that have this requirement:

4.2.8.2.  Geographic

   An emblem MUST be restrictable by geographic scope.

   Use cases that have this requirement:

4.2.9.  Identity Binding

   An emblem MUST be possible to associate with a person or group of
   people.

   Use cases that have this requirement:

4.2.10.  Human-Readable Validation Data

   An emblem MUST be capable of providing additional relevant
   information (e.g., photographs, unique identifiers) which can be used
   to corroborate the association of the digital emblem with the entity
   bearing it.

   Use cases that have this requirement:
